Put the original videos in data/stable directory.
Run the myDriver Script in code directory


Currently the script works for cars.avi.
If you want to make it work of coastgaurd replace cars with coastgaurd in all the files.

There should be a directory called shaky in data folder

Put the cars.avi file in data/stable folder

Put the files that are present on the homework link in the code directory. I am removing libavbin.so, libavbin.so.64 libavbin.so.32 files due to size limitations
